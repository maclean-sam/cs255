Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, wanted a system that helps students pass their DMV tests because there is an abundance of people who are in need of practice for passing those tests. The materials offered include coursework, in-person classes, and driving practice with a dedicated instructor. 

What did you do particularly well?

I thought I created the diagrams well and identified the requirements well when it came to the design templates. I made a list of the key information from the interview transcript to create meaningful visuals and write-ups. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the platform constraints to include more information since I did not have a lengthy write up for that part of the document. I would include more constraints and more details for the existing information. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I thought about the basic user's needs for any platform and used the interview transcript with DriverPass to determine the user's needs and how they will be navigating the system. It is important to consider these needs because this system is made for the user so it only makes sense that the developers think in terms of how the user will be interacting with the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

To design software, I would first gather requirements and then come up with a plan or create a Ghantt chart for how the system development process is going to play out. To analyze and design a system, I would combine the use of charts and diagrams with write-ups to determine the future of the system.
